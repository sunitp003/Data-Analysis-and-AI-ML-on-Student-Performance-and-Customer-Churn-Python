# Data Analysis and AI/ML on Student Performance and Customer Churn

## Overview
This project involves analyzing datasets to derive meaningful insights. It combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, and AI/ML techniques to identify patterns and trends in student performance and customer churn.

## Features
- **EDA**: Exploratory analysis of datasets to understand trends and outliers.
- **Visualizations**: Insights represented through graphs and charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **AI/ML**: Machine learning models (e.g., classification, regression) implemented using scikit-learn.

## Skills and Tools
- **Skills**: Data Analysis, EDA, Machine Learning
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Instructions
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
